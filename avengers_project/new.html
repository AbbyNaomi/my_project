                            Another prevalent argument is that the God of Thunder was simply too exhausted at that point, having used all of his energy fighting Hela in Thor: Ragnarok. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This also makes sense considering that since the 2017 film began, the Avenger was already in a fight with Surtur, and he didn't get any breather until Asgard was destroyed and they were safely on board.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, if anything, he should've been more drained when he arrived in Wakanda, since he also had to endure the power from a star to forge Stormbreaker - and yet he seemed to still be at the peak of his power. Given this, the aforementioned theory makes a much better explanation as to why he was defeated quickly at the beginning of Avengers: Infinity War.
