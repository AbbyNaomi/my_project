                    Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, commonly known as ML or MLBB, is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Moonton, a ByteDance subsidiary. Since its release in 2016, the game has groADVANCE SERVER wn in popularity worldwide, most notably in Southeast Asia,[1] and has since surpassed the 1 billion downloads milestone, with peak monthly players of 100 million. In 2021, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang achieved an all-time gross of US$1 billion, with 44 percent of its revenue coming from outside Asia, making it the top mobile game of its genre with the most global appeal.[2][3]The game sets two teams of five against each other in real-time, with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and protect their own in a traditional battle arena game. Unlike traditional MOBAs, there is no hero leveling or pay to play aspect—winners and losers are determined by skill, ability, and strategy.

                    Following success, Moonton has tapped into the esports scene with the creation of several regional tournaments dubbed as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League (MPL) in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa regions that serves as a qualifier for the Mobile Legends World Championships where a total of 15 countries, including Japan, Russia, Turkey, and the United States, have participated so far.[5] It was also among the 6 games chosen for the first medal event of esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games held in the Philippines.[6]

                    Originally titled Mobile Legends: 5v5 MOBA,[7] the game's first release in 2016 was received with criticism due to similarities with another MOBA game, League of Legends. Riot Games sued Moonton for copyright infringement in July 2017. However, the action was dismissed by the Central District Court of California in the United States due to forum non conveniens.[8] Moonton has since done multiple remodeling and patch updates for differentiation and game enhancements.

                   Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) mobile game. The game is available for free and is only monetized through in-game purchases such as characters and skins. Each player controls a distinct "Hero" character with unique abilities and traits. The basic objective of heroes is defined by six roles: "Tank," "Marksman," "Assassin," "Fighter," "Mage," and "Support." These positions define each player's responsibilities for their respective teams. Players can also customize their heroes' builds, which include in-game equipment and emblems.[9]

                    Two teams of five players go against each other in real-time. Players will be matched in correspondence with their current ranking. There are seven ranks in the game with “Warrior” being the lowest followed by “Elite”, “Master”, “Grandmaster”, “Epic”, “Legend”, and the highest rank, “Mythic”.[10] A player can only invite and form a team with other players of similar rank or players that are one rank higher or lower.

                    Taking down the opposing base is the main goal to achieve victory. There are three lanes in the game: The gold lane (top), exp lane (bottom), and the mid lane. Depending on what side of the map (blue or red) a player starts on, the gold and exp lanes will be switching places. Between each lane is the jungle. The jungle can be divided into four parts: two between the enemy's lanes and two between a player's team lanes. The jungle has different creeps and monsters that offer buffs, experience, and gold.

                    A player can't attack the enemy base directly without taking down opposing turrets in at least one lane first. Each lane has three turrets that shoot at heroes and deal a ton of damage. To attack them without taking damage, a player needs help from their team's “minions”. Minions constantly spawn at the teams’ bases and travel down along each lane. The team to successfully destroy all the turrets in one or all lanes will increase their chances of destroying the opposite team's base.[11]
