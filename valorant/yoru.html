                    A radiant from Tokyo, Japan, Kiritani Ryo (Japanese: 桐谷 諒) is a man dedicated to uncovering his past. Specifically interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Kiritani's search has kept on bringing him to Kingdom's S22 container port. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his first visit, he broke into the facility and stole a mask from a set of samurai armor that allowed him to see into another dimension. He was later recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, "Yoru", and shortly after this his familiarity with S22 saw him returning there on assignment to prevent a spike detonation by hostiles from Omega Earth.[1][2]

                <p>
                    Still not done with S22 however, Yoru continued to return to the site despite having other missions to do for the Protocol and against the advice of his superiors. His research led him to discovering new information relating to both radianite and the alternate dimension that he could access and enter with his powers. Finding a part of the ship with older dimensional fabric, Yoru suddenly fell through into a space that felt as if he was traveling from "now to then". He pushed forward as far as he could and heard a woman's voice calling out to him, one he thought he recognized, but before he could answer back, the rift closed.
