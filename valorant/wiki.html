                        VALORANT takes place on a version of Earth in the near future following an event known as First
                        Light. This event spans the entire globe, leading to big
                        transformations to life, technology, and how governments operate. However, select people across
                        the globe start to gain abilities stemming from this massive
                        event. These gifted individuals are called Radiants.
                    </p>
                    <p>In response to First Light, a shadow organization founds the VALORANT Protocol, which pulls
                        together agents from all over the world. These Agents consist of
                        Radiants and other individuals equipped with Radiant technology. Due to the backstories of these
                        characters, the VALORANT team features interesting
                        dynamics as the individuals not only sometimes know each other, but they also come from a wide
                        spectrum of backgrounds ranging from crime to the
                        military.</p>
                    <p>VALORANT is a competitive tactical shooter from the first-person perspective. It takes place on a
                        near-future Earth and features a cast of characters known as
                        agents, each of which have their own unique set of abilities to create tactical opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ten players are divided into two teams, Attackers and Defenders, with the goal of winning the
                        most rounds. In order to win a round, a team must eliminate
                        the opposing team or complete their team-specific spike objective. First team who reaches 13
                        rounds, wins the game. The game starts in a lobby, where
                        players have to lock in their Agent. The lobby lasts for 80 seconds or until everyone has locked
                        in their Agent. Only one of each Agent can be selected on each
                        team and players cannot see which Agent has been picked on the opposing team until the first Buy
                        Phase. The Buy Phase occurs before each round and
                        lasts for 30 seconds. During Buy Phase, most areas of the map are inaccessible and the two teams
                        cannot meet each other. Therefore, Attackers cannot enter
                        sites and are only limited to areas near their spawn zone, while the Defenders can move freely
                        between sites, but not further than that. Players are also
                        allowed to buy weapons, shields, and abilities during this phase.</p>
                    <p>The project was conceived in early 2013 within a small R&D team of designers at Riot Games, who
                        were looking to innovate genres with closed legacy loops
                        into live service games. Tactical shooters are challenging and competitive, with a history over
                        competitive integrity. These ideas became core to the project,
                        and the game was developed alongside anti-cheat measures.[3]</p>
                    <p>VALORANT was announced with the codename "Project A" on October 15, 2019 through Riot Games' 10th
                        Anniversary edition of their "Riot Pls" blog, which
                        celebrated 10 years since the release of their multiplayer online battle arena video game League
                        of Legends. In an announcement video, Anna "SuperCakes"
                        Donlon, the executive producer, describes the game as a "character-based tactical shooter" which
                        focuses on competitive aspects and includes precise
                        gunplay. She also states that the game takes place on a "beautiful, near-future Earth" and
                        features a "lethal cast of characters, each with their own unique
                        abilities".</p>
                    <p>Riot further explains that the game will stay true to the high-consequential gameplay of other
                        competitive tactical shooters with the addition of unique
                        character abilities that create and open tactical opportunities. Riot emphasized their attention
                        on solving technical issues commonly found in other</p>
