                    Zyanya Mondragón is a Radiant from Mexico with the power to absorb life energy from the souls of people that she kills. After being affected by a disastrous event involving machines, Mondragón has a strong dislike for technology and humanity, believing herself and her fellow Radiants to be the true future for Earth. Before her time as a VALORANT Protocol agent, she set up a sanctuary to help people escape from Kingdom and heal, establishing a community there and becoming their protector and avenger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of them however hold the same place in her heart as her little sister, Lucia, someone who Mondragón has been close to losing. After her eventual recruitment into VALORANT as its eleventh recruit, "Reyna", she was able to work with some of the organization's scientists to set up a procedure that allowed her to transfer some of the life energy she collects into Lucia, keeping her alive - at least for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the process remaining inefficient and Lucia's fate still uncertain, Reyna continues to hunt down any enemies she finds in her way, gaining more life energy with every kill and more time bought for her sister. Reyna's aggressive, bitter nature however draws concern from some of her fellow agents, and some fear what she could end up becoming should she be unable to save Lucia...
